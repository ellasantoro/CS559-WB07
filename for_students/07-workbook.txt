[X] correct WB7 Canvas Assignment submission [none]: 
[X] correct WB7G Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[X] Some aircraft that isnâ€™t a donut [07-06-01]: 
[X] A propeller that spins (not the body) [07-06-01]: 
[X] More than one propeller spinning (per aircraft) [07-06-01]: 
[X] (at least) One aircraft that flies in a circle (or curved path) [07-06-01]: 
[X] aircraft points forward as it moves [07-06-01]: 
[X] multiple aircraft both moving, both with propellers [07-06-01]: my second aircraft has some issues, but it does move and have propellers, very sorry!!!
[X] Radar dish (or some pointable object) [07-06-01]: 
[X] Radar correctly points at aircraft (tracks as aircraft moves) - should use lookat [07-06-01]: 
[X] take out bouncing cube [07-08-01]: 
[X] place at least 1 more swing [07-08-01]: 
[X] place carousel [07-08-01]: 
[X] carousel has poles and ''horses'' [07-08-01]: 
[X] carousel has correct motion (spins, horses go up and down) [07-08-01]: 
[X] another moving object [07-08-01]: 
[X] equipment 1 is identifiable (can tell what it is) [07-09-01]: My equipment1 is a Mini Loader that can dig, the cabin is kind of like that of a
    golf cart cabin (see images online), so that is why i have a hollow square type shape. Degrees of freedom / UI's include x, z, theta, and the scooper
    rotation.
[X] equipment 2 is identifiable [07-09-01]: my equipment 2 is a garbage truck that is carrying a can in the front and can dump into the back part of the
    truck. Degrees of freedom / UIs include x, z, theta, and arm rotation
[X] equipment 1 has correct articulation [07-09-01]: x, z, theta, scooper rotation
[X] equipment 2 has correct articulation [07-09-01]: x, z, theta, arm lift
[X] UI works for 1&2 [07-09-01]: 
[X] good use of colors/materials for all equipment (not just one color) [07-09-01]: used different colors like blue and green
[ ] more complex motion [07-06-01]: 
[ ] multiple types of aircraft - each with an articulation/propeller [07-06-01]: 
[ ] more theme park rides (with hierarchical motion [07-08-01]: 
[ ] more theme park rides (with hierarchical motion [07-08-01]: 
[X] third machine identifyable with working articulation [07-09-01]: my third machine is a telescoping truck (see online), it can retract the telescope part and
    make it longer and shorter (retract and extend). for UI it has x, z, theta, and retract/extending pole.
[ ] at least one object has 4+ d.o.f. (beyond position/orientation) [07-09-01]:
